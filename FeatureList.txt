Feel free to update this if you think of anything else, just lmk when you do so.

Vaal Probability tool:
------------------Data we need--------------
-Item base-type (Are attribute requirements relevant?)
-Item level
-Desired corruption
-------------------Client Side--------------
-Drop-down menu for desired corruption (with alphabetical sorting)
-Auto completion when searching for corruption names.
-Itemlevel dependent corruption probabilities
-Have a 'view summary' button so that users can see all possible outcomes from
vaaling the item.
---------------------Economy----------------
-User input base price of item as well as vaal->chaos ratio. 
-User input value of desired corruption in chaos.
-When calculations are complete, use the probabilty of desired vaal implicit to
calculate whether they will come out on top over time.
-If we can figure out a way to pull data from currency.poe.trade these could be 
more automated.

------------Questions to Answer-------------
-Do we really want to use JavaScript? Java works for web apps like ours as well
-Are attribute requirements relevant?
-Which data-structure do we want to use to store the vaal corruption options?
	-Don't need to change data once it's read in.
	-Non-hierarchical.
	-Need to be able to sort data for dropdown menu (Or we can just hardcode that)
	-Will not be that large an amount of data.
